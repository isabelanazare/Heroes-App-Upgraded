# Heroes-App-Upgraded

Me and my team, we had to upgrade someone else's heroes app, using Angular 10 and .NET Core 3.1. 

We added role authorization, a real-time chat section using a socket, locations for heroes, villain entities and basic villain management, battle section for users based on bonus calculation and rewarding system, the ability to train powers etc.
